    """Iterate over nodes in forest and return score for root.

    Note that the returned score is not exponentiated, i.e. it is equivalent to
    the log of the sum of the exponentiated scores for individual parses in
    the forest:

    log(sum over parses(exp(sum over applications in parse(application score))))

    This function benefits from dynamic programming to compute this sum more
    efficiently.

    Also note that input arguments should not be batched. This function could
    potentially be made more efficient by implementing a batched version of
    this computation. However, the computation in this function is limited to:
      1. Control flow (while loop) and TensorArray read/write operations
      2. Gather operations over application_scores
      2. Summation and logsumexp
    So the overall amount of computation should be small relative to
    large encoders and computation of application_scores. Using an
    implementation that is not batched also allows for returning early
    for examples where the number of nodes is less than the maximum limit.

    Args:
      application_scores: <float>[max_num_applications] of raw scores (not
        exponentiated) for anchored rule applications.
      num_nodes: Integer number of nodes. By convention, the final non-padding
        node is the root node and should correspond to the `num_nodes - 1` index
        of the 4 `node_x` input tensors below.
      node_type_list: <int>[max_num_nodes].
      node_1_idx_list: <int>[max_num_nodes].
      node_2_idx_list: <int>[max_num_nodes].
      node_application_idx_list: <int>[max_num_nodes].
