"""Data structures for representing Quasi-Synchronous CFG (QCFG) rules.

Currently, both terminal and non-terminal symbols are simply represented
as strings, with special strings reserved for non-terminals.

QCFG rules used by NQG follow the following restrictions:
- There is only one non-terminal symbol, `NT`
- The only allowed non-terminal indexes are 1 and 2.
Therefore, we only need to reserve two strings to represent indexed
non-terminals.

We also expect all rules to be normalized as follows: a non-terminal with index
2 should never appear before a non-terminal with index 1 in the source
sequence.

Note that this data structure could potentially be improved:
1. A more flexible representation for terminal and non-terminal symbols
would avoid possible collisions between terminal and non-terminal symbols,
and allow for representing QCFGs that do not conform to the restrictions above.
2. Representing symbols as integers rather than strings may have computational
benefits for various operations over QCFG rules.
