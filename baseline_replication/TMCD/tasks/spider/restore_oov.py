"""Replace T5 SPM OOV character with `<`.

Certain punctuation characters are mapped to the OOV symbol in T5's
sentence-piece model. For Spider, this appears to only affect the `<` symbol,
so it can be deterministically recovered by running this script.

An alternative is to preprocess dataset to avoid OOV symbols for T5.
