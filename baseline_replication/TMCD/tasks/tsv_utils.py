r"""Utilties for reading and writing files.

Expected format for TSV file is that each line has one example, with each
element separated by \t. The number of element should be the same as
expected_num_columns.

Expected format for examples in memory is a list where each element is:
(element_1, element_2, ...), or [element_1, element_2, ...]
The number of element should be the same as expected_num_columns.
